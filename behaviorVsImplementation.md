Testing plays a vital role in keeping software maintainable. Having well written tests gives confidence in the code that you are writing, acts as a form of documentation, and ensures functionality remains the same when things are changed. However keeping bad tests is likely to cause more harm than good. Bad tests can instill a false sense of security and increase production time due in the future. But what is considered to be a poorly written test?

Well maintained tests assert against the behaviors of the module, whereas poorly written tests assert against implementation details of the module. Implementation details are how the module actually completes a task, whereas behavior is the result of a task completing. Its the difference between testing the cooling and dispensing components in an ice-cream machine vs testing whether cold ice-cream came out of it or not.

Testing implementation has two major issues, they can cause false negatives and false positives in your test results. False negatives occur when implementation details are changed, the functionality remains the same, but the tests fail because we were testing the details that changed. The other scenario is when implantation details are changed, the functionality changed along with it, but the tests still pass because those details weren't being tested. Testing implementation produces hard to maintain, unreliable tests and should be avoided when possible.
